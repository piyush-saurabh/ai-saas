## Notes

* Shadcn UI is a CSS framework. All the components (e.g. button) installed using shadcn will be stored in /components folder.


### Folder Structure
* /app will contain all our routes
    * /app/globals.css: generated by shadcn ui
    * /app/page.tsx will be the default route /
* /components will have components from shadcn
* /lib/utils.ts will be used to merge tailwind classes
* 

## Routing
* /app/page.tsx will be the default route /
* /app/test/page.tsx will be located at /test
* We can use **Route Groups** to have a folder inside /app folder without having route on that. More details: https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/route-groups
    * add parenthesis around the folder to avoid effecting the route.

## Authentication

Provider: https://clerk.com/

**Setup**

Ref: https://clerk.com/docs/nextjs/get-started-with-nextjs

```
# Install Clerk
npm install @clerk/nextjs

# Import Clerk Provider in /app/layout.tsx
import { ClerkProvider } from '@clerk/nextjs'

```

Wrap entire application inside Clerk Provider
```
return (
    <ClerkProvider>
      <html lang="en">
      <body className={inter.className}>{children}</body>
    </html>
    </ClerkProvider>
    
  )
```

Create a file `middleware.ts` in application root and paste the content
```
import { authMiddleware } from "@clerk/nextjs";

// This example protects all routes including api/trpc routes
// Please edit this to allow other routes to be public as needed.
// See https://clerk.com/docs/nextjs/middleware for more information about configuring your middleware
export default authMiddleware({});

export const config = {
  matcher: ["/((?!.*\\..*|_next).*)", "/", "/(api|trpc)(.*)"],
};

```

Clerk nees to have the folder `sign-in/[[...sign-in]]` and `sign-up/[[...sign-up]]` for the authentication to work. We can name the folder to anything but but the folder should have same name.

By default all the routes will be protected. We have to explicitly add public route in `middleware.ts` file
